    Mongo orchestration layer for player-game aggregation.

      Always resolve and aggregate the full matching population so positional
      ranks/percentiles/PAR are comparable. `scope="player"` still loads that
      population, then upserts only the requested playerId(s). For a custom
      game list, comparison players are aggregated over the intersection of
      their appearances with those same game IDs.
